# Smarter Defect Mod
This is a mod to the game Slay the Spire. It is a booster pack that adds new cards for the Defect character. 

## Idea
I asked ChatGPT to generate a booster pack mod for the Defect. The prompt and response is below:

edited wording to be consistent with base game as needed
cards are not balanced, try to stay as faithful to gpt as possible

## About me
This is my first Slay the Spire mod. The guide I found the most useful is [https://github.com/Alchyr/BasicMod/wiki](https://github.com/Alchyr/BasicMod/wiki "Alchur's Wiki"). 

TODO:
1. Card description strings
2. Card art
3. Power icon art
4. Power icon flashes
5. Attack animations
6. Remove unecessary imports and other warnings
