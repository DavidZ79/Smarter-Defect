# Smarter Defect Mod
This is a mod to the game Slay the Spire. It is a booster pack that adds new cards for the Defect character. 

## Idea
I asked ChatGPT to generate a booster pack mod for the Defect.

Prompt:
im trying to make a mod for the game slay the spire. The idea is to make a booster pack: add a few cards to the character "defect". i need some ideas for what kind of cards i can add

Response:
Creating new cards for Slay the Spire, especially for the Defect (a character that synergizes with orbs), can be a fun experience. When creating cards, always keep in mind the existing mechanics and try to introduce new interactions that would be interesting and balanced. Here are some ideas:

1. Plasma Chain (Rare Skill)
Cost: 2 Energy
Effect: Evolve all Plasma Orbs. For every Plasma Orb, channel 1 Lightning Orb.

2. Power Grid (Uncommon Power)
Cost: 1 Energy
Effect: Every time you channel an orb, gain 2 block.

3. Quantum Shift (Rare Skill)
Cost: 0 Energy
Effect: Shuffle your orbs (randomly reorders the sequence of your orbs).

4. Resonance (Common Power)
Cost: 1 Energy
Effect: Every time an orb is evoked, all other orbs deal 2 damage to a random enemy.

5. Stabilizer (Uncommon Skill)
Cost: 1 Energy
Effect: Evoke your next orb twice.

6. Energy Flux (Rare Power)
Cost: 2 Energy
Effect: At the start of your turn, channel a Plasma Orb if you have an empty orb slot.

7. Circuit Overload (Rare Attack)
Cost: X Energy
Effect: Deal 7 damage X times. Evoke your rightmost orb X times.

8. Zero Point (Common Power)
Cost: 1 Energy
Effect: Whenever you channel a Frost orb, gain 1 Focus for this turn.

9. Orbital Resurgence (Uncommon Skill)
Cost: 2 Energy
Effect: Channel the last type of orb you evoked.

10. Magnetic Pulse (Uncommon Attack)
Cost: 1 Energy
Effect: Deal 8 damage. If the enemy intends to attack, channel a Frost Orb.

11. Static Discharge+ (Rare Power)
Cost: 3 Energy
Effect: Every time you receive unblocked damage, channel a Lightning Orb and a Dark Orb.

12. Energy Sink (Uncommon Skill)
Cost: 1 Energy
Effect: Consume all Plasma orbs. Gain 1 Energy for each.

13. Quantum Leech (Rare Attack)
Cost: 2 Energy
Effect: Deal 15 damage. For every Dark Orb channeled, heal for 5 HP.

14. Synergy Matrix (Rare Power)
Cost: 2 Energy
Effect: At the start of your turn, evoke the rightmost orb and channel the leftmost orb.

15. Orb Amplifier (Uncommon Power)
Cost: 1 Energy
Effect: Your orbs have +1 capacity.

When developing these cards, it's important to playtest thoroughly to ensure they aren't overpowered or too weak. You should also consider creating custom card art and flavor text to enhance the player's experience.

edited wording to be consistent with base game as needed
cards are not balanced, try to stay as faithful to gpt as possible
difficulties on certain cards, feedback is appreciated! i plan to work on more mods in the future
